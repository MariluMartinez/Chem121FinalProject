  <p>Rosalinda is my younger sister. She is 18 years old, loves the color pink, and just graduated from Buena High School. She has Cerebral Palsy, specifically spastic quariplegia cerebral palsy. </p>
  <p>Rosalinda has trouble with using her left arm. She can't grasp objects very well. Her right arm is more functional. Both of her legs are stiff and she can't control the muscles, so she can only walk when using a walker. For longer distances (like walking at Disneyland!) she uses a wheelchair. Rosa has vision problems, hearing problems, and eating problems. She has low mouth control, which leads to lots of drooling. She also can't talk very well. And as I mentioned earlier, she is 18 years old but is truly about 9 years old mentally and emotionally.  </p>

  <h4> Her Treatment: </h4>
  <p>Rosa has had multiple surgeries on her legs. From what I know and remember, they cut into her legs, and shortened certain muscles above her knee so that they could bend easier. She had another surgery on her calves muscles to adjust their strength. There are no other surgeries left to better her muscle strength or leg mobility.  </p>
  <p>Rosalinda also does physical therapy twice a month with a professional physical therapist, and four times a month with her caretaker. </p>
  <p>Rosa does occupational therapy once a month where she learns how to cook, good hygiene habits, and managing money. </p>
  <p>Rosa has braces for her legs to give her bettwe support. She also wears glasses to help her vision problems. She has a communication tablet to help her communicate with others. </p>
  <p>Rosalinda takes vitamins for her general health, like vitamin D. She also takes a medicine called Glycopyrrolate to help with the excessive drooling. </p>

  <p>I will walk more about Glycopyrrolate in the next page!</p>
